## Questions
    
I decided that it would be a good idea not to have input validations so that the user can still use the README.md structure as a template for their own input. I regret that the project is not currently able to take in lists or multiple line input from the user and would like to see the ability to do that in the future but that might mean a change to how the prompts are generated.
